# Impostor 2

The impostor game but improved. A bit.

## Game Flow

1. Set up the game
- Choose total number of player, from a minimum of three up to a maximum of ten.
- Set total number of impostors, from a minimum of three up to a maximum of total players minus one. You can also set it to random, but it can never be less than one or greater than or equal to the total number of players.
- Set the names of all the players. Leaving the fields blank prevent you from proceeding with the game.

2. Play the game
The player number in order of names provided in the previous section will be displayed with a card. The player will click on the show button to see whether they have been assigned a word or the 'impostor' role. The player should hide the word/role before clicking the next player button.

## To-Be-Added

1. A voting system
To allow players to vote out the possible impostor/s in the game. In case of more than one or random number of impostors, the system will indicate players to keep looking for the impostors.

That's all for the time being.
